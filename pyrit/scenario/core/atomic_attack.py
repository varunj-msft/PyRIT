AtomicAttack class for executing single attack configurations against datasets.

This module provides the AtomicAttack class that represents an atomic test combining
an attack, a dataset, and execution parameters. Multiple AtomicAttacks can be grouped
together into larger test scenarios for comprehensive security testing.

Eventually it's a good goal to unify attacks as much as we can. But there are
times when that may not be possible or make sense. So this class exists to
have a common interface for scenarios.
